# farmstation

Remake of the great [farmr_dashboard](https://github.com/josea/farmr_dashboard).

It doesn't intent to be a 1-to-1 feature copy, but it does use many of his ideas, code structure and even the client at this time. 

This is built in Blazor Server .NET, thought out as a series of docker containers, so it should be easy to deploy in different platforms (current going is Amazon's ECS).
